State update batching only happens in React 18 & later. It happens not only in event handlers, but in Promises, setTimeOut etc. 

It can be opted out using:- flushSync(()=> {})

flushSync(() => {
  setLikes(0);
});

flushSync(() => {
  setShowDetails(0);
});



Always use callback in setState() functions, whenever the new value depends upon previous value.

If the new state is same as the previous state, then React will not try to update the state. So, it will not re-render the component instance.
